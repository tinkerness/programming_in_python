'''Write a program to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the appropriate prompts for the triangle's base and height, and use the names of the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area.'''

base = int(input("enter base: "))
height = float(input("enter height: "))
area = 0.5*base*height
